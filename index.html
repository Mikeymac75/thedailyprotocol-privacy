    <h1>Privacy Policy for The Daily Protocol</h1>
    <p><strong>Last Updated:</strong> July 21, 2025</p>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>Welcome to The Daily Protocol ("we," "our," or "us"). We are committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information in our mobile application (the "App").</p>

    <h2>Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
    <p>Our App is designed around the principle of anonymity. We do not require you to create an account, and we do not collect any Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Your name</li>
        <li>Your email address</li>
        <li>Your phone number</li>
        <li>Your precise location</li>
        <li>Your device's contacts or photos</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Information We Collect</h2>
    <p>The only information the App interacts with is non-personal and anonymous:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Commit Actions:</strong> When you "commit" to a daily mission, the app sends an anonymous signal to our server to increment a global counter. This signal contains no information that can be tied to you or your device.</li>
        <li><strong>Saved Date:</strong> To prevent multiple commits in a single day, the app saves the date of your last commit locally on your device's storage. This information is never transmitted to us or any third party.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Data Security</h2>
    <p>We are committed to ensuring that your experience is secure. Since we do not collect any personal information, the risk of a data breach involving your personal data is eliminated.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>
    <p>We may update our Privacy Policy from time to time. We will notify you of any changes by posting the new Privacy Policy on this page.</p>

    <h2>Contact Us</h2>
    <p>If you have any questions about this Privacy Policy, you can contact us at: info@thedailyprotocol.org</p>
